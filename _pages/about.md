ðŸ‘‹ Greetings, I'm Ching-Hao, a dedicated deep learning researcher driven by a profound passion for AI for healthcare and equality of AI. I received my bachelor's degree and master's in Computer Science from National Tsing Hua University. I am the incoming PhD student at University of Notre Dame in Computer Science and Engineering program. 
  
As a former student and visiting researcher at [National Tsing Hua University](https://nthu-en.site.nthu.edu.tw/) at [Theta Lab](http://theta.cs.nthu.edu.tw/) and [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/) at [Sustainable Computing Laboratory (SCL) Lab](https://www3.nd.edu/~scl/index.html), I focused on connecting robustness, generalization, and fairness, through the unsupervised or weakly supervised learning manners in medical domain and yielded several research papers at top conferences and journal (AAAI, MICCAI, Medical Image Analysis) of machine learning and medical image.

I am enthusiastic about leveraging my expertise and adept problem-solving skills on a global scale. Currently, I am in active pursuit of a summer internship opportunity within the United States. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me to talk about potential openings.
