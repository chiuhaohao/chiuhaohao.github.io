ðŸ‘‹ Greetings, Iâ€™m Ching-Hao, a deep learning researcher dedicated to applying AI to healthcare. I received my bachelorâ€™s and masterâ€™s degrees in Computer Science from National Tsing Hua University. I will begin my PhD in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame in Fall 2025.

As a researcher at the [Theta Lab](http://theta.cs.nthu.edu.tw/) of [National Tsing Hua University](https://nthu-en.site.nthu.edu.tw/) and the [Sustainable Computing Laboratory (SCL) Lab](https://www3.nd.edu/~scl/index.html) of the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), I focus on promoting fairness in AI diagnostics in the medical field. I have published several research papers in top conferences and journals, including AAAI, MICCAI, and Medical Image Analysis.

My research primarily focuses on AI for healthcare, AI fairness, and computer vision. I am passionate about leveraging my expertise and strong problem-solving skills on a global scale. If you are interested in my work or would like to collaborate, feel free to contact me via email: cchiu3@nd.edu.
